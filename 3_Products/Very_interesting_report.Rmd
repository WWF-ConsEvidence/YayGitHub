```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

setwd('..')

source('2_Analysis/Really_awesome_analyses.R')

```


### Why my report is so awesome

1. All of my super cutting edge analyses
2. I only have to run this single code, and the rest is sourced from my wonderfully organized repo
3. Completely reproducible

<br><br>

See my cool data? I've printed it below:
  
```{r read.data}

print(unique(data$type.plant))

```

### Continue reading, to learn more about my very interesting analyses
  

I have made a plot to show you my cool results! Check it out!


```{r plot, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(data, aes(x = type.plant, y = height)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",
           fill = "dark green")

```

### Adding new content to my report!

Just came up with this really unique analysis -- finding the mean height of each plant type!

```{r means}
